# Ruby Capstone Project

## Project Description 

In this project, you will create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games.

The data will be stored in JSON files but you will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.

- Add new book, music album or game.
- List all created and saved items
- test all classes
